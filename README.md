# Wiretap Game


## How it Works
The game consists of 2 teams, the Allies and the Enemies. No one knows who is on what team. The Allies consist of 2 players, a sender and receiver. Everyone else is on team Enemies. The goal is for the sender to give a  5 digit code for a lock to the receiver without the enemies knowing what the code is.

## Game Play
Players can try to get everyone to know their roles however they see fit. The 2 Allies will have two signals to look out for. Examples of signals: "scratching the chin", "blinking quickly", etc. But the allies need to be careful because one of the enemies will know one of their signals. 

The Receiver will also know 2 of the 5 numbers but may not be in the correct position or order.

If a player thinks they have the code, at anypoint they can try to open the lock. The first team to open the lock wins. The sender can attempt to open the lock, but the code will always be wrong even if they're using the correct code.

Each player gets only one attempt to open the lock. Therefore, if the receive opens the lock and the code is incorrect, the enemies automatically win.

### Special Actions
There are 4 actions that can be used by anyone at any point: Blind, Mute, Kill and Veto. Actions are used simply by someone declaring it, example: "I will blind John". Players may vote to use an action, but they don't need to. Each action may be used only once. If an action is vetoed, then that action and the veto can no longer be used. Blind and Mute will only be applied for a period of 90 seconds.

## General Rules
* If an action like opening the lock or using a special action is declared by two players at once, the tie will be broken by a coin flip.
* If the receiver is killed, the enemies automatically win
